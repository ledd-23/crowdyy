## Getting started
1. Download JDK 11.0.17 at https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html. Check if java is installed
```sh
$ java --version
java 11.0.17 2022-10-18 LTS
```
2. Download IntelliJ at https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/. Ultimate Edition is prefered. Students can apply for a free liscence. If not, Community Edition is fine.

3. Maven 3.8.1 comes bundled with IntelliJ, so you don't need to download it. If your Maven version is different, consider downloading 3.8.1 at https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.8.1/. Set the correct Maven path in IntelliJ. Choose the relevant file for your OS. 

4. Open the project in IntelliJ. It should already have a run configuration ready. Click the green play button on the top right corner to run the server. Be sure to have the Docker database instance running locally before doing this.
